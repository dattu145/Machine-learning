 Certainly! Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates the calculation of a confusion matrix for a spam detection model in Python  :
 	
 """
	
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# True labels (ground truth)
true_labels = np.array(['spam', 'not spam', 'spam', 'not spam', 'spam', 'not spam', 'not spam', 'spam'])

# Predicted labels by the model
predicted_labels = np.array(['spam', 'spam', 'spam', 'not spam', 'not spam', 'not spam', 'spam', 'spam'])

# Compute confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(true_labels, predicted_labels, labels=['spam', 'not spam'])

# Print confusion matrix
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(cm)

"""

In this example, we have two classes: 'spam' and 'not spam'. The true_labels variable contains the actual ground truth labels, while the predicted_labels variable contains the labels predicted by the model.

The confusion_matrix function from scikit-learn is used to calculate the confusion matrix. It takes the true labels, predicted labels, and a list of class labels as input. In this case, we explicitly specify the labels as ['spam', 'not spam'].

The resulting confusion matrix, cm, is printed, which provides a summary of the model's performance:
	
"""

#  OUTPUT  : 

"""

Confusion Matrix:
[[3 2]
 [1 2]]
 
"""
"""

##       Interpreting the confusion matrix:

True positives (TP): The model correctly predicted 3 instances as spam.

True negatives (TN): The model correctly predicted 2 instances as not spam.

False positives (FP): The model incorrectly predicted 2 instances as spam when they were actually not spam.

False negatives (FN): The model incorrectly predicted 1 instance as not spam when it was actually spam.

By examining the confusion matrix, you can further calculate various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score if desired.
